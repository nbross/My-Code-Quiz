# My-Code-Quiz
## A quiz app with questions related to coding. Basically showcasing my ability to code with JavaScript and use of local storage.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
